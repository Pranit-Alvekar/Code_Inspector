        <p className="primary-text">
          From our 6-month PGDAC course at CDAC ACTS, we skillfully employed
          diverse tech stacks to create the user-friendly Code Inspector app. It
          streamlines assignment processes and owes gratitude to our faculty for
          guidance. The app provides students an intuitive dashboard for
          tracking reviews and successful submissions.

            engagement in backend Spring Boot development, security
            implementation, and JWT integration played a pivotal role in honing
            my expertise and knowledge.
