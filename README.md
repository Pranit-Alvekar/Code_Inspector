# Assignment Submission & Review App

Welcome to the Assignment Submission & Review App! This comprehensive app streamlines the process of submitting assignments, getting them reviewed, and facilitating communication between students and code reviewers. Below, you'll find an in-depth guide to the app's features, setup, and usage.

## Features

### Student Dashboard

Upon successful login, students are greeted with an intuitive dashboard that delivers essential information:

- **Upcoming Assignments:** Students can view a list of assignments along with their due dates.
- **Past Submissions:** Access a page to review past assignment submissions.
- **Review Status:** Instantly know the review status of assignments currently under evaluation.
- **Submit & Re-Submit:** Submit new assignments or re-submit modified ones with ease.

### Assignment Submission

Submitting assignments is effortless:

- **GitHub Repository:** Enter the GitHub URL of a public repository containing the assignment solution.
- **Branch Selection:** Choose the appropriate branch that showcases the correct solution.
- **Submission Status:** Assignments transition from "pending submission" to "submitted" upon successful submission.

### Code Review Process

Code review is a collaborative process, smoothly integrated into the app:

- **Reviewer Notifications:** Active code reviewers receive email notifications for new assignments.
- **Claiming Assignments:** Code reviewers can claim assignments they want to review.
- **Assignment Status:** The status of assignments changes from "submitted" to "in review" upon claiming.

### Feedback and Revisions

The feedback loop ensures high-quality assignments:

- **Assignment Rejection:** Reviewers can reject an assignment if it doesn't meet the criteria.
- **Updating Assignments:** Rejected assignments move to "needs update," and students are notified.
- **Resubmission:** Students can revise their work and resubmit, shifting the status back to "in review."

### Completion and Notifications

Successful completion is celebrated with notifications:

- **Review Completion:** Reviewers complete their reviews by providing video recording URLs.
- **Student Notifications:** Students are notified of the completed review along with feedback.
- **Final Status:** The assignment's status transitions from "in review" to "completed."
